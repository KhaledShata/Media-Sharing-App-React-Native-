This React Native project is a media sharing application designed for managing and displaying multimedia files, such as images and videos, on mobile platforms. 


Features include:

- Uploading media files using expo-image-picker which allows selection of images or videos.
- Displaying media files from a server, handled by axios to fetch and display file details including likes and media type (image or video).
- Dynamic functionalities like liking/unliking and updating file details through a user-friendly interface.
- Real-time media management by fetching and displaying updated lists of files after each interaction.
- Fully Connected with the WEB version of the project through the same backend server.
